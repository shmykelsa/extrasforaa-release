### Are you bored of Android Auto UI? You can't stand the fact that on your car you have two clocks on the screen? Do you want to personalize your look of Android Auto tweaking the UI to your likings?

### If yes is the answer to any of the questions above, you are in the right place!

### Meet Extras For AA Collection, the most advanced way to tweak Android Auto's look

In case you missed it, I've made another Substratum Theme for Android Auto to personalize the default background. Check out [Wallpapers For AA now](https://github.com/shmykelsa/wp4aa-release)!

## 1. Extras For AA

Extras For AA is the first theme of the collection. It was born to be a theme to personalize some elements in Android Auto, and now it is a very comprehensive theme that can tweak a lot of things inside Android Auto. You will find it in the "release" section of this repository

## Custom bar modes!

One Button? Two Buttons? Three Buttons?

One Button: navbar is just launcher icon

Two Buttons: combine launcher icon with the recent app or notification icon

Three buttons: combine launcher with notifications and recent app

Madness Mode = Clock instead of launcher icon

+N = + Notifications 
+Q = + Quick access app
H = Horizontal
V = Vertical

There's an entire document covering most of the options available. [Check out now more previews](https://telegra.ph/Extras-For-AA-Previews-10-27)!

### LEGACY VERSION

If your device can't run Substratum Lite, download the specific version of Extras For AA which is called Legacy. This version is optimized for old devices that can't run Substratum Lite. 

If your device can run Substratum Lite, go for normal one!


## 2. Icons For AA

Icons For AA (previously Extras For AA Icons Special) is the special edition of Extras For AA, which has options dedicated to just icon swapping for Android Auto. With Icons For AA you can customize:

- Exit Icons
- Status Bar Icons
- Bottom bar Icons
- More to come!

## 3. Animations For AA

Third and newest theme from the Extras For AA collection. With Animations For AA, you can personalize:

- App switch animation
- App enter animation (Android Auto 6.1+)
- App exit animation (Android Auto 6.1+)

### [Download Repository](https://github.com/shmykelsa/animations-for-aa-release)

**Icons For AA and Animations For AA have no Legacy version**

**WARNING!!!** If Extras For AA gets updated is also a general good practice to make a clean install of overlays, so in order to avoid errors, uninstall previously built overlays, then you can install them again. If Android Auto gets updated **you MUST reinstall every option** otherwise Android Auto will likely fail to start :)

## Compatibility

## Android 11?

Substratum is very limited on Android 11 and for the time being it can only apply very light modifications to user-installed apps. This is out of my control and I don't know whether it will be fixed or not. Extras For AA has so many modifications and making a very light version for Android 11 is just not worth it. Icons For AA and Animations For AA will mostly work fine.

## Synergy?

For some reasons, Synergy won't apply themes outside of the phone's screen. This has been an ongoing issue since OneUI 1.0 and unfortunately I don't think it will be ever fixed. Blame Samsung!

## Android 6?

You can technically install Substratum on Android 6, but it relies on a old implementation that is not compatible with the actual Substratum. Android 6 is not supported.
